Title: Elastic Net with Dichotomised Outcomes
Description: Implements lasso and ridge regression for dichotomised outcomes (Rauschenberger et al. 2024, <doi:10.1080/02664763.2023.2233057>). Such outcomes are not naturally but artificially binary. They indicate whether an underlying measurement is greater than a threshold.
